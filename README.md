# Dicee Game

Welcome to the Dicee Game project! This is a simple web-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game emulates a dice roll competition between two players, and the player with the higher dice value wins.

## How to Play

- Clone the repository on your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` in your web browser.
- Click the "Refresh Me" button to roll the dice for both players.
- The player with the higher dice value wins. The winning player is indicated with a flag (ðŸš©).
- If both players roll the same value, it's a draw!

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Defines the structure of the game interface.

- CSS: Handles the styling of the game, including fonts and layout.

- JavaScript: Responsible for generating random dice values, updating the images, and determining the winner.

## Game Logic

The game follows these main steps:
1. When the "Refresh Me" button is clicked, the game generates random dice values for both players (from 1 to 6).
2. The game updates the images of the dice based on the random values.
3. The player with the higher dice value is declared the winner and indicated with a flag (ðŸš©). In case of a draw, it's labeled as such.

## Features

- **Random Dice Rolls:** The game generates random dice values for both players, creating an element of chance.
- **Visual Feedback:** The game provides visual feedback by changing the images of the dice and displaying the winner.
